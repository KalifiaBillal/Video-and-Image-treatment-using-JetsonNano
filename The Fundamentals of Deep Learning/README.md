## The Fundamentals of Deep Learning

| Item  | Description  |
|---|---|
| An Introduction to Deep Learning | Deep learning is a branch of machine learning which is completely based on artificial neural networks, as neural network is going to mimic the human brain so deep learning is also a kind of mimic of human brain. In deep learning, we don't need to explicitly program everything. The concept of deep learning is not new. |
| Appendix_ Gradient Descent | Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. The idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the gradient of the function at the current point, because this is the direction of steepest descent.|
| CNN | In deep learning, a convolutional neural network is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. |
| Data augmentation and Deployment | Data augmentation in data analysis are techniques used to increase the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data or newly created synthetic data from existing data. It acts as a regularizer and helps reduce overfitting when training a machine learning model. |
| Pre-trained Models | A pre-trained model is a model created by some one else to solve a similar problem. Instead of building a model from scratch to solve a similar problem, you use the model trained on other problem as a starting point. For example, if you want to build a self learning car. |
| Advanced architectures | Neural Networks are complex structures made of artificial neurons that can take in multiple inputs to produce a single output. This is the primary job of a Neural Network â€“ to transform input into a meaningful output. |
